<p>Everyone wants to rank in AI answers now. Fair. Just do not throw away the boring web work that still feeds those systems.</p>
<p>Guest posts and brand mentions are not “old SEO.” They are how you leave clear, citable footprints on sites that already have readers — and crawlers. This article keeps the claim practical: what changed, what did not, and how to buy placements without chasing hype.</p>

<h2>What actually changed</h2>
<p>People still Google. They also ask chat tools and skim AI overviews. Those systems lean on the public web: pages they can fetch, entities they can recognise, sources they have seen in more than one place.</p>
<p>So the job widened a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic SEO</strong> — rank your own URLs</li>
<li><strong>AEO / AI visibility</strong> — be mentioned and cited when answers are assembled</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not pick one and ignore the other. A strong page with zero third-party presence is easier to overlook. A pile of random links with no clear brand story is noise.</p>

<figcaption>Topical placements — pick sites that already talk about your subject, not only sites with a high score.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Why guest posts still earn their keep</h2>
<p>A decent guest post does three jobs at once:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Referral path</strong> — humans can click through</li>
<li><strong>Crawl path</strong> — search engines discover and associate URLs</li>
<li><strong>Entity path</strong> — your brand name appears in a real sentence on a real site</li>
</ol>
<p>That third job matters more when answers are summarised. Models and overviews need phrases like “according to…” and repeated brand+topic pairs. A clean article on a relevant site is still one of the simplest ways to create that pair on purpose.</p>
<p>Dofollow helps. It is not the only thing that helps. A clear brand mention on a trustworthy page can still be useful — especially next to a sensible link, not instead of any quality bar.</p>

<h2>Brand mentions without the fluff</h2>
<p>“Get mentioned everywhere” is not a strategy. Mentions that work tend to look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>your brand named in context (product category, use case, geography)</li>
<li>on a site that already covers the topic</li>
<li>with a URL readers would actually trust</li>
<li>written like an article, not a press release pasted into a blog theme</li>
</ul>
<p>If the piece could be swapped onto any casino or CBD site without editing, it will not teach an AI (or a human) who you are.</p>

<figcaption>After go-live — check indexation and attributes; AI visibility still needs pages that stay findable.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>How to buy for AI-era SEO without getting silly</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose topical sites</strong> — use <a href="{$choose}">the selection guide</a>; niche fit over vanity DR.</li>
<li><strong>Write like a source</strong> — specifics, numbers, clear positioning. See the <a href="{$brief}">brief guide</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Name the brand the way you want it repeated</strong> — consistent spelling, product category nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Verify the live URL</strong> — <a href="{$liveCheck}">checklist</a>. A removed page helps nobody, AI included.</li>
<li><strong>Mix channels</strong> — marketplace volume + occasional PR when you have a real story (<a href="{$compare}">comparison</a>).</li>
</ol>

<h2>What not to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy 50 unrelated sites because someone said “AI needs volume”</li>
<li>Stuff “ChatGPT” into every title</li>
<li>Ship spun content and hope embeddings will forgive it</li>
<li>Ignore indexation — unindexed pages are invisible to almost every system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where SEOLinkBuildings fits</h2>
<p>We are a guest-post marketplace, not an AI magic box. The useful part is operational: filter publishers, pay from a wallet, track orders, fix or dispute bad delivery. That is how you place topical articles at a pace a small team can manage.</p>
<p>Browse the <a href="{$marketplace}">marketplace</a> overview, then <a href="{$register}">register</a> when you want to shortlist real listings. Keep the content honest. Keep the niche tight. Let the mentions accumulate somewhere they make sense.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>What does AEO mean here?</h3>
<p>Answer Engine Optimization — making your brand easy to cite in AI answers and overviews, not only to rank as a classic blue link. Same web presence work, wider audience.</p>
<h3>Do AI systems only care about dofollow links?</h3>
<p>No. Clear brand mentions, topical articles, and trusted domains matter even when a link is nofollow or missing. Links still help discovery; they are not the only signal.</p>
<h3>Should I stop classic SEO for AI SEO?</h3>
<p>No. Useful pages, technical health, and relevant referring domains still matter. AI visibility usually builds on the same public web footprint.</p>
<h3>How does a marketplace help?</h3>
<p>It gives you a controlled way to place topical articles on real sites — with prices, order tracking, and QA — instead of hoping a cold email lands.</p>
