        return <<<HTML
<p>A marketplace order can look finished and still go wrong a week later. The article disappears. The anchor changes. The dofollow link turns into a bare mention. That is not “SEO variance.” That is a delivery problem.</p>
<p>SEOLinkBuildings expects completed placements to stay live as agreed. When they do not, you have a reporting path — with a clock on it. This page explains that path without the legal small print (that lives on the <a href="{$refund}">refund policy</a>).</p>

<h2>First: make sure it is actually gone</h2>
<p>Before you open a dispute, do a five-minute check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the live URL from the order in a private window.</li>
<li>Confirm the target URL and anchor (or note exactly what changed).</li>
<li>Check whether the page 404s, redirects oddly, or the link attribute changed.</li>
<li>Save a screenshot with the date visible if you can.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our <a href="{$liveCheck}">post-live checklist</a> is built for this moment. If you never logged the original URL, you are arguing from memory — and memory loses disputes.</p>

<figcaption>Verify the live page before you escalate — URL, anchor, and link attributes.</figcaption>

<h2>The 30-day reporting window</h2>
<p>After completion, advertisers can report a removed (or broken) placement for <strong>30 days</strong>. That window is not endless on purpose. Campaigns need a clear cut-off; publishers need to know when a job is closed.</p>
<p>Practical advice: put a calendar reminder at day 7 and day 21 for every completed batch. Spot-check the URLs. It takes minutes.</p>

<h2>How to report from the order</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the order in your advertiser Orders view.</li>
<li>Use the report / dispute action for that completed item.</li>
<li>State what failed in plain language: removed page, missing link, wrong attribute, etc.</li>
<li>Include the live URL you were given and any proof.</li>
</ol>
<p>Order chat is still useful for a quick “hey, the page 404s — can you restore?” Some publishers fix it the same day. If they do not, escalate while you are still inside the window.</p>

<figcaption>Orders — keep the thread and report from the completed placement while the window is open.</figcaption>

<h2>What happens when we uphold the dispute</h2>
<p>If the report is upheld:</p>
<ul>
<li>the order amount can return to your <strong>wallet</strong> as credit</li>
<li>the publisher payout for that order is clawed back</li>
<li>if the publisher already withdrew those funds, we record a debt and block further withdrawals until it is sorted</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point matters. Clawback is how the marketplace stays fair when money has already left the publisher wallet. Details and edge cases sit in the <a href="{$refund}">refund policy</a> and <a href="{$faq}">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>For the money flow before and after a dispute, read <a href="{$wallet}">wallet, escrow &amp; refunds</a>.</p>

<h2>What this is not</h2>
<ul>
<li>A guarantee that every ranking will rise</li>
<li>A free rewrite service forever</li>
<li>A cash wire back to your bank for every complaint</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a rule that completed placements should stay available, with a concrete way to push back when they do not.</p>

<h2>Habits that prevent ugly surprises</h2>
<ul>
<li>Log every live URL the day it arrives</li>
<li>Approve or request revision inside the 72-hour review window after live URL submission</li>
<li>Re-check completed links inside the first month</li>
<li>Prefer publishers with clear samples and realistic turnaround over mystery “DR 90” rows</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are just getting started, <a href="{$register}">register as an advertiser</a>, buy one placement, and practice the log + re-check habit before you scale spend.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>How long do I have to report a removed link?</h3>

<h3>What do I get if the dispute is upheld?</h3>

<h3>Does every missing page automatically win?</h3>
<p>No. We review the case. Bring the live URL you were given, proof it is gone or altered, and the order ID. Vague claims slow everyone down.</p>
<h3>Should I still log placements after approval?</h3>
<p>Yes. Keep live URL, target URL, anchor, and date. That log is what makes a removal report easy to uphold.</p>
